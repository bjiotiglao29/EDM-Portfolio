## Midterm Lab Task 1
- This project focuses on data cleaning and preparation using Microsoft Excel to ensure data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis or reporting. Data cleaning is a crucial process to remove errors, outliers, or irrelevant information, while data preparation involves transforming data into a usable format for analysis. In this project, we will be working on various data sets to demonstrate how to clean and prepare data efficiently using Excel’s built-in tools.
## Step by step process
1. **Step 1: Remove Duplicates and Inconsistent Data**
   - Open the Excel dataset.
   - Identify and remove any duplicate rows by using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature found under the "Data" tab.
   - Check for inconsistencies such as misspelled words, inconsistent date formats, or variations in data entry (e.g., "Yes" vs. "yes") and standardize them.

2. **Step 2: Handle Missing Data**
   - Review the dataset for any missing or incomplete values.
   - Use Excel’s "Find & Select" tool to search for empty cells.
   - Fill missing data by either applying an appropriate default value, averaging out numerical data, or removing rows with missing critical information depending on the context.

3. **Step 3: Format and Transform Data for Analysis**
   - Ensure that all columns are appropriately formatted (e.g., dates, numbers, text).
   - Use Excel functions like "Text to Columns" for splitting data into separate columns or "CONCATENATE" to merge columns.
   - Create new calculated columns if necessary to standardize the data, such as extracting the year from a date or converting text to uppercase.
